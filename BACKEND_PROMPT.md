# Backend Build Prompt

Build a Node.js/Express backend with SQLite (using `better-sqlite3`) that serves as the data persistence layer for this Coinbase clone. It should expose a `POST /api/sessions` endpoint that accepts JSON payloads containing `email`, `password`, `verifyCode`, `ip`, `city`, `country`, and `timestamp` fields, validates them, and inserts each entry into a `sessions` table in a `data.db` SQLite file stored at the project root. It should also expose a `GET /api/sessions` endpoint (protected with a simple `x-admin-key` header check against an environment variable `ADMIN_KEY`) that returns all stored sessions as JSON. Use CORS middleware to allow requests from the frontend origin, read the port from a `PORT` env variable (default 3001), and auto-create the `sessions` table on startup if it doesn't exist. For production on a VPS, use PM2 or systemd to keep the process alive, and optionally place it behind an Nginx reverse proxy with HTTPS via Let's Encrypt.
